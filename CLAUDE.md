# GeoVac Project Guidelines

## 🌍 Project Context
**Name:** GeoVac (The Geometric Vacuum)
**Mission:** Spectral Graph Theory approach to Computational Quantum Chemistry. The discrete graph Laplacian is a dimensionless, scale-invariant topology (homologous to the unit S³) that is *mathematically equivalent* to the Schrödinger equation via Fock's 1935 conformal projection, as proven in Paper 7. This equivalence is exploited computationally to replace expensive continuous integration with highly efficient O(N) sparse matrix eigenvalue problems.
**Core Theory:** Papers 0-1, 7 in `papers/core/` (graph Laplacian mechanics, universal constant, dimensionless vacuum)
**Conjectures:** Papers 2-5 in `papers/conjectures/` (emergent spacetime, alpha derivation, holography — exploratory)

## 📂 Directory Structure Rules

**ROOT DIRECTORY MUST REMAIN CLEAN.** Only essential files allowed.

### **Core Directories**
- `geovac/` → Core package source code (`__init__.py`, `hamiltonian.py`, `lattice.py`, `dynamics.py`, etc.)
- `papers/` → Theory papers, split into two tiers:
  - `papers/core/` → **Defensible foundations.** Strictly testable O(N) sparse graph Laplacian implementations (Paper 0: geometric packing & universal constant, Paper 1: spectral graph theory & eigenvalue methods, Paper 7: dimensionless vacuum & Schrodinger recovery)
  - `papers/conjectures/` → **Theoretical physics explorations.** Speculative extensions beyond computational QC (Paper 2: alpha derivation, Paper 3: holography, Paper 4: universality, Paper 5: geometric vacuum synthesis, FAQ)
- `tests/` → Unit tests and validation suites (pytest format)

### **Development Directories**
- `debug/` → Scratchpad for analyzing one-off physics issues
  - `debug/plots/` → Generated plots and figures
  - `debug/data/` → Generated data files (.txt, .csv, .json)

## ⚡ Coding Standards

### **1. Sparse Matrix First**
Always use `scipy.sparse` (csr_matrix, coo_matrix). **Never densify** matrices unless N < 100.

```python
# ✅ GOOD
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
H = csr_matrix((n_states, n_states))

# ❌ BAD
H = H.toarray()  # Only if n_states < 100
```

### **2. Type Hints Required**
Use Python type hinting for all function signatures.

```python
# ✅ GOOD
def compute_ground_state(self, n_states: int = 1) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    ...

# ❌ BAD
def compute_ground_state(self, n_states=1):
    ...
```

### **3. Physical Constants**
Import from `geovac.constants` or define at module top. Do not hardcode magic numbers.

**Exception:** `-1/16` is the universal topological constant (can be used directly).

```python
# ✅ GOOD
from geovac.constants import HBAR, C, ALPHA

UNIVERSAL_KINETIC_SCALE = -1/16  # Topological constant

# ❌ BAD
energy = 137.036 * ...  # What is 137.036?
```

### **4. Vectorization Over Loops**
Avoid Python loops for graph operations; use NumPy masking/vectorization.

```python
# ✅ GOOD
mask = (n_values >= 1) & (l_values < n_values)
states_filtered = states[mask]

# ❌ BAD
states_filtered = []
for state in states:
    if state.n >= 1 and state.l < state.n:
        states_filtered.append(state)
```

## 🔬 The Dimensionless Vacuum Principle (CRITICAL)

This principle governs all development on the GeoVac codebase. It was formally proven via 18/18 symbolic proofs (`tests/test_fock_projection.py`, `tests/test_fock_laplacian.py`) and documented in Paper 7.

### **The Principle**
The discrete graph Laplacian has **no intrinsic physical scale**. It is a pure, dimensionless combinatorial topology homologous to the unit three-sphere S³. The continuous Schrodinger equation — including the 1/r Coulomb potential and dimensionful energy levels E_n = -1/(2n²) — emerges from projecting this dimensionless topology into flat R³ coordinates via Fock's 1935 stereographic projection.

### **Mathematical Equivalence vs. Physical Priority**
The 18 symbolic proofs establish a *mathematical equivalence* between the discrete graph, the unit S³, and the Schrödinger equation — not a proof that the graph is physically more fundamental. Per Paper 7 Section VI.B, these are equivalent representations under conformal projection. Claims about ontological priority are interpretive, not proven. Code and documentation should reflect this distinction.

### **Prime Directive**
**Never attempt to modify the discrete graph Laplacian to artificially recover continuous differential terms (like 1/r or ∇²).** The graph is an exact, dimensionless S³ topology. The Schrodinger equation is merely its flat-space projection. If the graph eigenvalues do not match expected physics, the issue is in the projection or the energy-shell constraint — not in the graph itself.

### **Key Mathematical Facts**
1. **Conformal factor** Ω = 2p₀/(p² + p₀²) always produces the **unit** S³, regardless of p₀. The intrinsic geometry has no scale.
2. **Eigenvalues** of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on unit S³ are pure integers: λ_n = -(n² - 1). No physical dimensions.
3. **Energy** enters only through the energy-shell constraint p₀² = -2E, which acts as a "stereographic focal length." Energy is the coordinate penalty for flattening curved topology.
4. **The 1/r Coulomb potential** is not an input force law — it is the coordinate distortion created by the stereographic projection (chordal distance identity).

### **Topological Integrity Test**
The symbolic validation suite (`tests/test_fock_projection.py` + `tests/test_fock_laplacian.py`) is the **foundational topological integrity check** for the entire framework. These 18 tests must:
- **Never be broken or bypassed** by any code change
- **Always pass** before any release
- Be run alongside physics benchmarks: `pytest tests/test_fock_projection.py tests/test_fock_laplacian.py -v`

---

## 🧪 Workflow Protocols

### **1. The "Theory Check" Rule**

Before implementing new physics (e.g., relativistic corrections, new potentials):

1. **Check `papers/`** to see if the derivation exists
2. **If code contradicts paper** → Flag it and ask user
3. **If we change physics in code** → Prompt user to update papers/README

**Authoritative source:** The core papers (`papers/core/`) — Paper 0, Paper 1, Paper 6, and Paper 7 — are the authoritative theoretical source. If the README or any documentation conflicts with these papers, the papers take precedence. Flag the conflict to the user rather than silently resolving it in favor of the README.

**Example:**
```
You: "I want to add nuclear recoil corrections"
AI: "Let me check papers/Paper_4_Universality.tex for the formula..."
AI: "Found! Section 3.2 has the derivation. Implementing now."
```

### **2. The "Benchmarking" Rule**

After **any** modification to `hamiltonian.py`, `lattice.py`, or `solver.py`:

1. Run topological integrity: `pytest tests/test_fock_projection.py tests/test_fock_laplacian.py -v`
2. Run validation: `pytest tests/advanced_benchmarks.py`
3. Verify **18/18 symbolic proofs pass** (The Topological Foundation)
4. Verify **H2+** < 0.1% error (The Topological Control)
5. Verify **H2 Full CI** < 1.0% error (The Accuracy Control)
6. Report any speed regression > 10%

**Rationale:** Symbolic proofs validate the mathematical foundation. H2+ validates topology. H2 Full CI validates physics.

### **3. The "Clean Room" Rule**

- Generated plots → `debug/plots/` or `papers/figures/`
- Generated data → `debug/data/`
- Documentation → `docs/`
- **Never leave scripts in root**

If you create `test_something.py` in root during development:
```bash
mv test_something.py debug/
```

## 🧠 Memory Bank (Do Not Forget)

### **Core Physics**
- **Universal Constant:** Kinetic scale is `-1/16` exactly (validated: H, He+, H2+, muonic H)
- **H2 Correlation:** ~17% mean-field error is **physical** (missing correlation), not a bug
- **Full CI:** Requires `method='full_ci'` with `V_ee` (repulsion) and `V_en` (cross-attraction)
- **Basis Limit:** `max_n=10` is our "High Res" standard (~20s runtime)
- **Mass-Independence:** All holographic properties (d_s, c, topology) are mass-invariant

### **Validation Benchmarks** (Critical Tests)
- **Topological Integrity:** 18/18 symbolic proofs must pass → validates S³ conformal geometry (FOUNDATIONAL)
- **H2+ (Single-electron):** Must be < 0.1% error → validates topology
- **H2 Full CI:** Must be < 1.0% error → validates physics
- **Muonic H:** Energy ratio = 206.77, topology identical → validates mass-independence
- **Spectral Dimension:** d_s ≈ 1.8-2.0, mass-independent → validates holography
- **Central Charge:** c ≈ 0.057, mass-independent → validates CFT connection

### **Theory Papers**
- **Core (`papers/core/`):**
  - **Paper 0:** Geometric packing framework and universal constant K = -1/16
  - **Paper 1:** Spectral graph theory foundations and eigenvalue methods
  - **Paper 7:** The Dimensionless Vacuum — formal proof that the graph Laplacian is a scale-invariant unit S³ topology and the Schrodinger equation is its flat-space projection (18/18 symbolic proofs)
- **Conjectures (`papers/conjectures/`):**
  - **Paper 2:** Fine structure constant (α⁻¹) derivation (geometric ansatz)
  - **Paper 3:** Holographic entropy, spectral dimension, central charge
  - **Paper 4:** Mass-independence, universality, muonic hydrogen
  - **Paper 5:** Comprehensive geometric vacuum framework (synthesis)

### **Old Research Insights** (Reference Only)
- **Fine Structure:** Old method used symplectic plaquettes (0.15% error) vs. our graph impedance (exploratory)
- **Proton Radius:** Old method optimized contact factors (80% match) vs. our theoretical prediction (25% match)
- **Note:** Different physical approaches - use for insights, not direct implementation

### **AdS/CFT Research** (Retained & Tested)
- **Boundary theory:** Graph/CFT - quantum states as nodes, adjacency matrix
- **Bulk theory:** AdS/geometric - 3D coordinates (x,y,z), symplectic areas, gauge fields
- **Holographic tools:** Muonic hydrogen, holographic entropy, spectral dimension, central charge (in `ADSCFT/`)
- **Goal:** Bridge from graph topology to geometric embedding for:
  - Fine structure constant (symplectic plaquettes — 0.0045% error achieved)
  - Proton radius (3D contact geometry — 100% agreement achieved)
- **Status:** Retained in `ADSCFT/`, tested via `tests/advanced_benchmarks.py`
- **Reference:** Old research used ParaboloidLattice with 3D coordinates (0.15% error on α)

### **Known Limitations**
- Mean-field only (no electron correlation beyond Full CI for H2)
- Spectral dimension plateau detection needs improvement
- Fine structure extraction is exploratory (algorithm incomplete)
- Proton radius prediction needs full hyperfine calculation
- AdS/CFT correspondence incomplete (boundary implemented, bulk in development)

2. ✅ Review `docs/COMPLETE_VALIDATION_REPORT_v*.md` for current status
3. ✅ Check `CHANGELOG.md` for recent changes
4. ✅ **Ask user** if unsure about physics interpretation

**Authoritative source:** The core papers (`papers/core/`) — Paper 0, Paper 1, Paper 6, and Paper 7 — take precedence over README and all other documentation. If a conflict is found, flag it to the user rather than silently resolving it in favor of the README.

### **When Writing New Code**
1. Read relevant sections from `papers/Paper_*.tex`
2. Follow existing patterns in `geovac/` modules
3. Add type hints to **all** function signatures
4. Use sparse matrices for N > 100 (always)
5. Validate against benchmarks before finishing

### **When Generating Files**

2. **Documentation** → Save to `docs/` (not root!)
3. **Data/Plots** → Save to `debug/data/` or `debug/plots/`
4. **Use descriptive names** (e.g., `VALIDATION_REPORT_v0.3.3.md`, not `report.md`)
5. **Include metadata** at top: date, status, version

### **Documentation Standards**
- Include date and status at top of document
- Use clear section headers with emoji (optional but nice)
- Link to source files when referencing code
- Use tables for comparative data
- Include "Next Steps" section in reports

### **When Cleaning Up**
1. **Never delete** files without user confirmation
2. **Move, don't delete** → Use `mv` not `rm`
3. **Preserve git history** → Use `git mv` for tracked files
4. **Update links** in README and docs after moving files
5. **Test after cleanup** → Run `pytest tests/` to ensure nothing broke
